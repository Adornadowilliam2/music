        <b>[Intro]</b>
        <br />
        Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Verse 1]</b>
        <br />
        Holdin' me back Gravity's holdin' me back I want you to hold out the
        palm of your hand Why don't we leave it at that? Nothin' to say When
        everything gets in the way Seems you cannot be replaced And I'm the one
        who will stay, oh-oh-oh
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        <br />
        In this world, it's just us You know it's not the same as it was In this
        world, it's just us You know it's not the same as it was As it was, as
        it was You know it's not the same
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Verse 2]</b>
        <br />
        Answer the phone "Harry, you're no good alone Why are you sitting at
        home on the floor? What kind of pills are you on?" Ringin' the bell And
        nobody's coming to help Your daddy lives by himself He just wants to
        know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        <br />
        In this world, it's just us You know it's not the same as it was In this
        world, it's just us You know it's not the same as it was As it was, as
        it was You know it's not the same
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Bridge]</b>
        <br />
        Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet I don't wanna talk about the
        way that it was Leave America, two kids follow her I don't wanna talk
        about who's doin' it first
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>[Outro]</b>
        <br />
        (Hey) As it was You know it's not the same as it was As it was, as it
        was
      </p>
