    <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
    <br>
    I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
    I need your loving, loving, I need it now
    When I'm without you, I'm something weak
    You got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees</p>
    
    <p><b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    I don't wanna be needing your love
    I just wanna be deep in your love
    And it's killing me when you're away
    Ooh, baby
    'Cause I really don't care where you are
    I just wanna be there where you are
    And I gotta get one little taste</p>
    
    <p><b>[Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    Your sugar, yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    I'm right here, 'cause I need
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life
    Your sugar, yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    </p>
    
    <p><b>[Verse 2]</b>
    <br>
    Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
    Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
    When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
    You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for</p>
 
    <p><b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    I don't wanna be needing your love
    I just wanna be deep in your love
    And it's killing me when you're away
    Ooh, baby
    'Cause I really don't care where you are
    I just wanna be there where you are
    And I gotta get one little taste</p>
    
    <p><b>[Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    Sugar, yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    I'm right here, 'cause I need
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life
    Your sugar, yes, please (Your sugar, yes, please)
    Won't you come and put it down on me?</p>
   
    <p><b>[Bridge]</b>
    <br>
    Yeah
    I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
    Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
    I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
    'Cause girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
    Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
    Don't give me all that shy shit
    No makeup on, that's my sugar</p>
    
    
    <p><b>[Chorus]</b>
    <br>
    Sugar, yes, please (Please)
    Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
    I'm right here, 'cause I need (I'm right here, 'cause I need)
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life (Yeah)
    Your sugar, yes, please (Your sugar, yes, please)
    Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
    Sugar, yes, please
    Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me!)
    I'm right here, 'cause I need (I'm right here, 'cause I need)
    Little love, a little sympathy
    Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
    Need a little sweetness in my life
    Your sugar, yes, please (Your sugar, yes, please)
    Won't you come and put it down on me?
    (Down on me, down on me, ooh)</p>
