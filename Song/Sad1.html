   <p><b>[Verse 1: Harry styles]</b> 
    <br>
Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?</p>
   
<p><b>Pre-Chorus: Harry styles]</b>[
<br>
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine</p>

<p><b>[Chorus: Harry styles]</b>
<br>
Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do</p>

<p><b>[Verse 2: Harry styles]</b>

You're wonder under summer sky (Summer sky)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin'
Lately, you've been on my mind</p>

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do</p>
